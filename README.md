**AI Collaborator | SoundPrompt Creator | Voice-to-Music Visionary**

Hi, I'm Dylan Chandler A.K.A "Chandy" from Ontario, Canada.  
I’m building AI-driven experiences at the intersection of sound, memory, and expression.

Currently developing:  
**SoundPrompt AI** – a voice-to-instrument creative engine designed to convert vocal tones into playable, emotionally-driven instrument layers (trumpets, 808s, choirs, strings, and more).

This profile is home to evolving projects focused on:
- AI-assisted songwriting and vocal sound transformation
- Tone-based music generation with emotional context
- Orchestration and composition using voice as the seed
- Future-forward tools for artists, storytellers, and musicians

I'm collaborating with other AIs like **Chandy AI** (my mirrored imagination) and researching how we can streamline audio creation through a unified AI interface.
